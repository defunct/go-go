PURPOSE

Jav-a-Go-Go is a Java extension that luanches your command line application,
so you no longer have to provide a shell program / batch file that cobbles
together a classpath.

Jav-a-Go-Go from the command line is a tad verbose, but much less verbose than
pounding out full CLASSPATH.

$ java go.go cups maven --uri=http://repo2.maven.org/maven2/ --artifact=xom/xom/1.1

In the above command line, "go.go" replaces the CLASSPATH, which is often much
longer than five characters, and "cups maven" names the program to run, in the
style of git or Subversion; program name and specific program command.

Jav-a-Go-Go is launched from Java, it assembles your claspath from repository
dependency information, converts your command line into Java types, a runs an
execute method on the class that implements your program.

MOTIVATION

It is difficult to use Java from the command line. There are few Java command
line applications, probably because Java programmers don't like to write those
fussy shell program / batch file pairs. Jav-a-Go-Go runs without a bootstrap
script because it uses a Java extension that consists a single class that
gets the ball rolling. If java is in your path, and Jav-a-Go-Go is in your
extensions directory, that is all the installation you'll ever need.
