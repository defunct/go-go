Ideally, I'd like each of these pages to be an expression of the project's nature, with a stab at a design for each project. Jav-a-Go-Go can have a sillotte of a Hullabloo era Go-Go dancer.

This websites can maintain project blogs as well.

I'm disappointed that I'm having a hard time editing in ViM. I'm not able to get the wrapping to work as expected.
